<div>You continue left, you know it’s mind games but you have the feeling that you are being watched, you turn to find a person, or…creature has been following you the entire time. You don’t know if it is dangerous or not. You are never given the chance to find out before you pass out and when you wake up you're back on the now familiar road you started on, it is the same time, it is still raining. You ponder, “What happened?”</div>
