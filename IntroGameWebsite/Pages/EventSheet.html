In lines 1 anad 5 give players 1 and 2 the ability to fall through the platofroms when it is permitted by the platfomrs behaviours. lines 2-5 give player 2 controls using the WASD keys. In lines 7-10 the events that occur make it so that when the top platforms are knocked/ fall into the 'basket' both the player on that side and the platform are reset and a point is added to the score of that player. </p>
